### Fixed

- **Images:** when a scan or a new image folder brings images your assistant hasn't examined yet, **Images** now asks to investigate them instead of reading **Done**, as the assistant's `images --status` already did, and look-alike image families only group images in the folder **Images** reads.
- **Images:** an empty list of images to translate no longer reads "Nothing left to translate" before your assistant has examined the images; it says they are not examined yet and offers **Copy investigation task**.
- **Assistant-led:** your assistant no longer translates plugins the game never runs, such as turned-off plugins, a plugin listed a second time, or DazedTL's own Forge plugin, and leaves alone the choice help names MPP_ChoiceEX finds its help by; in a project counted before, **Progress** reads the text count as out of date until your assistant counts again.
