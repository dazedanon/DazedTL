# Game Translation

End-to-end playbook for translating a Japanese game to English: **detect engine → extract player-facing text → translate behind a locked glossary + game bible → inject/patch → validate in-game**.
The translation must preserve meaning and character voice in natural English, alongside complete text coverage, stable terminology, and intact game controls.

## One prompt owns the whole run

The default request is a complete local translation and patch delivery. The user selects
the game and a few options, copies one prompt, and watches progress. Preparation,
translation, review and delivery are internal phases, not tasks the user must select.
Inspect saved status, source/translation stores, Git baselines, QA evidence and any
persisted API jobs before deciding where to begin. Resume valid work automatically;
repair missing or stale work without restarting completed phases. If the delivery is
already current and verified, report its paths and evidence instead of retranslating it.

Handle tools, backups, extraction, speaker mapping, references, glossary, game guidance,
translation batches, scoped images, fitting, injection, targeted QA, checkpoint commits,
packaging and progress reports yourself. Completing setup.md's guidance-only phase is
the transition into translation, not a stopping point. Do not ask for another prompt,
task selection, manual file transfer or permission to continue at routine phase boundaries.
Explicitly narrower user instructions, such as preparation only or a targeted correction,
still define the scope; a legacy project.json task label does not.

Continue until the local delivery is verified or a question only the user can answer
blocks progress: spending approval, a missing API connection, denied access, or a decision
no source evidence settles. Never ask for routine confirmations or for checks you can make
yourself; record a check you cannot make, such as a screenshot, as pending and continue.
Finish independent work before asking. In API mode, handle cost review in the same
conversation and carry forward valid spending authorization. Do not ask the user to
return to the app to estimate requests or copy a second prompt. Resume after the answer.
When a session or environment limit forces a handoff, save exact next actions and current
progress; the same starting prompt resumes the work. Do not promise background execution
after the assistant session ends. Uploading and publishing remain separate requests.

## DazedTL shared integration

Read `references/project-lifecycle.md` for the required source preservation, local Git
baseline, checkpoints, resumable artifacts and delivery phases. These are part of the
same starting prompt, before and after the engine-specific translation work.
`main` contains only the reviewed runtime patch and minimal repository metadata.
`original` retains matching untranslated runtime files for backup and version updates;
translation-only additions have no fabricated original.
All `.dazedtl` working records, source copies and QA artifacts remain ignored on both.
Use the live `git-scope` helper described in the lifecycle before patch checkpoints.
Read `references/progress-reporting.md` and maintain the compact progress panel after
each saved batch or milestone, and at least every 10 minutes during active work. Export saved unit records and call the live
`scripts/len_translation.py progress-update` helper; keep the narrative in `status.md`.
The agent maintains this throughout the run without another user prompt.
For a fresh task, use the selected untranslated game as the initial source baseline.
Normal preparation such as `TranslationUpdateCheck` does not make it an existing
translation. Create any needed backup from that folder; do not demand a separately
downloaded pristine copy unless concrete evidence shows the selected source is unsuitable.

For RPG Maker, use the same preparation steps as Workflow before translation:
run `DAZEDTL_ROOT/scripts/len_translation.py rpgmaker-prep --game-root <game>` to
format game JSON and plugin configuration and install GameUpdate with the MV/MZ
startup check. Then use `git-setup` to record the prepared untranslated baseline.
`setup.md` loads Workflow's RPG Maker speaker, glossary, wrapping and investigation
instructions for these games. For Ace, complete the existing Workflow extraction/
RV2JSON prerequisite and format its JSON export (`--data-path` if not in `ace_json`),
leaving native Marshal files intact. Other engines keep their own preparation route.
Existing updater configuration, README and ignore rules are preserved on reinstall.
Len's **Install Forge** checkbox defaults on for MV/MZ and is saved as `install_forge`.
The preparation command honors it through Workflow's bundled installer and saved
playtest settings. For an already prepared game, use `forge-setup --game-root <game>`
with the same script. An unchecked choice skips installation/updates and does not
remove existing Forge. Forge does not apply to Ace or other engines; do not ask for
another confirmation after the user has selected this option.

This copy lives at `DAZEDTL_ROOT/data/skills/game-translation`. Resolve DAZEDTL_ROOT
as the bundled engine folder three levels above this skill folder, inside the DazedTL
application. Shared prompt defaults live in its sibling `../data/skills` folder and
are loaded through the application resource resolver. `tools/...` paths
are relative to this skill folder; `DAZEDTL_ROOT/...` paths use the live application.
Use current source symbols rather than historical line numbers in the reference examples.

The Len's Method handoff names the selected game and `.dazedtl/len-method` workspace.
Use the SAME project guidance as Workflow: `.dazedtl/glossary.txt`,
`.dazedtl/skills/game.md`, `.dazedtl/skills/quirks.md`, and the user's other custom
`.dazedtl/skills/*.md`. Setup and investigation are supplied in `setup.md` in that
workspace. The identity rules, evidence hierarchy, and ownership rules there also
apply to this route. Preserve source-supported uncertainty and reveal-sensitive aliases.

The handoff's `context.json` is generated by the live shared system-prompt loader.
For a single batch, run `DAZEDTL_ROOT/scripts/len_translation.py context --game-root
<game> --sources <JSON list of JP strings or ID-to-JP object> --output <request.json>`.
Use its system prompt and matched glossary in direct translation or the adapted API
driver. SFX and reference translations are advisory. Refresh after guidance changes;
retain the request fingerprint with retries and review records. Add a suitable
`--instruction-key section.key` for a field-specific shared instruction template.
Under DazedTL's project helper, save the extracted lines as source units and run `organize` instead, as described in `references/direct-workflow.md`; it groups and compiles every request, so the game text never passes through the assistant's own writing.
The compiler itself makes no API calls and exports no credentials.

For dialogue, also pass `--speakers <speaker JSON>` with the same IDs or list positions
as the source batch. Use resolved source names and null for unidentified speakers.
The compiler includes current speakers' glossary guidance and puts the line-to-speaker
map in the returned `user` context, keeping the translatable source body unchanged.
Send that complete `user` field to the model. Keep actual nameplate translation and
injection separate from this metadata. Preserve speaker/scene associations in stores
and use the request fingerprint for cache/retry decisions; text-only dialogue dedup
can reuse the wrong character's voice. The agent extracts speaker metadata itself.

Apply the shared prompt's dialogue pass in both direct and API work: draft the exchange, read the
English in order for reply continuity, rhythm and distinct voices, then check every revision
against the Japanese for meaning, ambiguity and emotional force. Use source-supported voice notes
from `references/glossary-and-prompts.md`; preserve deliberate stiffness or formality in the source.
Apply the shared prompt's "Laughs and Character Sounds" guidance during drafting and polishing.
Preserve distinctive laughs, interjections, verbal tics, and recurring phrasing; natural English must not erase their recognizable sound or timing.
Use `references/sfx-onomatopoeia.md` for voiced sounds versus descriptive SFX and `references/glossary-and-prompts.md` to record recurring choices per speaker.
This is part of composing each translation, not a requirement for a second full-game provider run.
Keep scene boundaries and speaker associations when splitting batches, and check exchanges spanning
a split together at the next review checkpoint. Recheck controls and fit after wording changes.

When the user names previous games or a reference-corpus folder in the starting
instructions, follow `references/reference-translations.md` during setup. Inspect all
specified prequels, promote verified recurring terminology into this game's shared
glossary, and register aligned pairs for exact source matches. Handle discovery and
registration yourself within the selected task; the user need not configure a dialog
or supply a second prompt. Keep the supplied references read-only.

An existing JSON glossary can be imported through the same script's `import-glossary`
command. Conflicting current names block import until deliberately resolved. Keep old
JSON as an archive, and make all future guidance edits in the shared files. Historical
`glossary.json`, `game_prompt.md`, `vocab.txt` and provider prompts in the example
pipelines are adaptation examples. They are not additional authoritative files for this
integration. Keep longer synopsis, route and research notes in the workspace; assemble
translation instructions from the shared files without repeating their contents.

Keep authored tools, reviewed translation records and QA notes under the handoff's `.dazedtl/len-method/work/`.
Keep all workspace files ignored on both game branches and preserve separate workspace backups.
Verify that Git tracks only the runtime patch and corresponding originals, with native bytes intact.

Read and reuse Len's tools, copying those that need adaptation into the workspace.
Use live DazedTL modules instead of a frozen DazedTL extract. Do not run a reference
pipeline with its original game's absolute paths or write generated output into the
application's shipped tool directories. Existing project-local copies from the earlier
ZIP integration may contain useful adaptations; preserve them and reconcile relevant
work with this shared contract rather than replacing them.

Before writing translated MV/MZ game JSON, follow the `_original` preservation
procedure in `references/engine-rpgmaker.md`, including when an external store is
used. Stage reference-injector output and finalize each file with the live
`scripts/len_translation.py write-rpgmaker-json` command. Existing reference
injectors do not call it automatically. Keep source metadata immutable on reruns
and verify the final source/live QA mappings. For native/binary formats, retain
equivalent source and injection sidecars in the separately backed-up workspace without changing engine schemas.

## Select the work mode before translation

The handoff explicitly names **Assistant only**, **Live API** or **API Batch**.
Keep that choice visible in the opening update and resume notes.
Direct work uses the coding assistant's access and plan limits; DazedTL makes no translation API calls.
Follow the user's delegation instructions and read `references/direct-workflow.md` for batching, context reuse and validation cadence.

API Batch work reads `references/api-batch.md` first.
Reuse the app's API Settings, pricing helpers and supported Batch backend.
Prepare extraction, shared guidance and source units locally before paid submission; `organize` compiles the requests and the run carries the quote.
A whole-job price remains unavailable until the complete unit inventory exists; do not label missing prices as $0.
Present the run's quote in the conversation and obtain any missing spending authorization before starting it.
Changed source, scope, guidance, references or API settings require a fresh estimate; a quote is not a spending cap.

Only an explicit preparation-only request ends with extraction, guidance, request plan and validation plan.
For every mode, images follow the user's selected scope; finding Japanese art does not expand it.

## Age evidence in cartoony and stylized games

Cartoony, chibi and super-deformed art styles are common across adult casts.
Do not infer that a character is underage or exclude text solely from stylized proportions, short stature, a youthful face or an ambiguous label such as “girl”, "child", "kid", etc.
Distinguish the game's general visual style from specific evidence about a character's age or depiction.
Use established age/adulthood lore, the complete scene context and relevant user clarification; do not start a cast-wide age investigation merely because the art is stylized.
Before creating or reinstating an age-related exclusion, read `references/review-decisions.md` and reconcile prior corrections and retractions.
Carry a reviewed adult-context conclusion forward when its evidence is unchanged; reopening it requires specific contrary evidence, not the same appearance-based inference.
Keep any justified restriction specific to the supported scene/participant rather than extending an ambiguous cue to a species, group or the whole cast.

## Work in measured milestones

1. Detect the engine/build, read its reference, and inspect the relevant existing tools in `references/tools-catalog.md` before adapting a pipeline.
2. Preserve the source and prove a small delivery canary before bulk translation.
   Its mechanical checks are enough; a visual check you cannot make stays pending and never stops the run.
3. Inventory player-facing text independently of the extractor, including plugin/script labels, runtime-generated text and authorized images.
   Keep stable occurrence IDs, source hashes, speaker/scene associations and an explicit unresolved/excluded ledger.
   Reconcile disputed or repeated exclusions with prior reviews and user corrections using `references/review-decisions.md` before changing scope.
4. Build shared glossary and game guidance using `references/glossary-and-prompts.md` and any user-supplied reference games.
   Preserve placeholders, control flow, internal identifiers, source-supported identity and uncertainty.
5. Translate, perform the source-checked dialogue pass, and save resumable batches with complete compiled context.
   Validate changed units immediately, then run corpus checks at bounded milestones instead of restarting the same full audit after every batch.
6. Fit both width and row count against the actual renderer using `references/text-fitting.md`.
   Check headings, icons, dynamic values and body text separately.
   Read compact JP-to-EN UI pairs for meaning and consistent names; automated checks cannot detect every misleading label.
7. Inject reviewed output and check the actual installed files, independent source/live mappings and save identity.
   For MV/MZ, use the source-preserving writer and set `System.json.locale` to `en_US` on every English output; check locale-sensitive plugins and English name input as described in `references/engine-rpgmaker.md`.
8. Run targeted native checks for affected renderers, windows, triggers and save behavior using `references/playtesting-and-release.md`.
   Record which scenes ran, which fixtures were synthetic and what remains untested.
   A full playthrough or a second tester is optional unless the user requests it; do not spend days grinding routes to finish a text QA task.
9. Re-inject before packaging, verify the payload allowlist and hashes, and test installation in a clean matching game copy.
   Follow the lifecycle's runtime-only Git scope and separate workspace backups.
   Draft a forum post only when requested, using `references/forum-post.md`; publishing requires its own authorization.

Update `progress.json` from saved records after batches/milestones and at least every 10 minutes while working.
Tell the user the completed/discovered count, whether corpus coverage is audited, the current phase, estimated remaining active work, the next milestone and any blocker.
Keep translation, review, image work, injection, QA and packaging separate.
Use measured throughput plus explicit phase estimates; suspend estimates when scope or evidence changes.
Show excluded and unresolved player-facing text counts and reasons alongside eligible progress.
A text bar at 100% never establishes release readiness.

## Engine detection

Look for these indicator files in the game folder:

| Indicator | Engine | Reference | Delivery |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data.win` / `game.unx` with `FORM`, `GEN8`, `STRG` (and `CODE` for VM) | **GameMaker** | **`engine-gamemaker.md`** | UTMT-backed per-literal append-and-redirect archive patch |
| `*_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll` (+ `MonoBleedingEdge/`) | **Unity Mono** | `engine-unity-mono.md` | BepInEx 5 Harmony dictionary hook / force-locale |
| ...plus `PlayMaker.dll` and no JP in `Assets/Scripts/` | **Unity Mono + PlayMaker** | `engine-unity-mono.md` | Same, plus a `CsvReader.LoadFromString` prefix for CSV script tables |
| `GameAssembly.dll` + `global-metadata.dat` | **Unity IL2CPP** | `engine-unity-il2cpp.md` | BepInEx 6 IL2CPP Harmony hook |
| `package.json` + `nw.dll` / `www/` / `js/plugins/` | **RPG Maker MV/MZ** | `engine-rpgmaker.md` | Loose `data/*.json` + plugins |
| `Data.wolf` / `*.wolf` / `*.wolfx` | **Wolf RPG** | `engine-wolf.md` | WolfDawn unpack→inject→repack |
| `data/data.rbpack` + `data/bakinengine.dll` | **RPG Developer Bakin** | **`engine-bakin.md`** | `AppDomainManager` hook overlaying the launcher's temp folder |
| `data.dts` + SRPG Studio `game.exe` | **SRPG Studio** | `engine-srpg-studio.md` | Patched exe + loose `Project/` JSON |
| `Engine/` + `*.pak`/`*.utoc`/`*.ucas` | **Unreal** | `engine-unreal.md` | retoc/repak/UAssetGUI → patch pak |
| `*.xp3` | **KiriKiri** | `engine-vn-engines.md` | XP3 unpack/repack |
| `Scene.pck` + `Gameexe.dat` + `SiglusEngine.exe` | **Siglus** | `engine-vn-engines.md` | Binary patch Scene.pck + exe + g00 |
| `*.ypf` / `*.ystb` | **YU-RIS** | `engine-vn-engines.md` | YPF/YSTB extract/repack |
| `resources/app.asar` or `app/` + `data/scenario/*.ks` | **TyranoScript/Builder** | **`engine-tyranoscript.md`** | Build-dependent loose override or verified ASAR installer |
| `*.pck` (Godot) | **Godot** | `engine-vn-engines.md` | PCK extract/repack |
| DXA archive + vertical-text images | **Trois** | `engine-vn-engines.md` | Loose-file override + font trick |
| `*.rpgproject` / `*.rmmzproject` / `.rpgmvp` / `.png_` | **RPG Maker MV/MZ (encrypted)** | `engine-rpgmaker.md` | Decrypt then loose `data/` |
| `Data/*.rvdata2` or `Game.rgss3a` | **RPG Maker VX Ace** | `engine-rpgmaker.md` | Ruby Marshal in place (`acetl/rvmarshal.py`), then EXTRACT the archive and move it aside - RGSS3 reads the archive before a loose file |
| `Data/*.rvdata` / `*.rxdata` | **RPG Maker VX / XP** | `engine-rpgmaker.md` | same Marshal round trip; only the class names differ |

If you can't tell, run Detect It Easy (`tools/.NET/die/diec.exe`, a download listed in `tools/THIRD-PARTY.md`) on the main exe, or check for a `_Data` folder (Unity) vs `www`/`data` (RPG Maker) vs a single big archive (VN engine).
