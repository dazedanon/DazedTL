## Phase 2 — Global localization investigation

Discover systemic localization families that ordinary per-line review misses. Turn confirmed
families into preventive guidance before translation or bounded correction work afterward.

## Boundaries

- Do not edit runtime game data or translated text as part of investigation.
- Follow the containing workflow's explicit guidance-file write contract.
- Do not certify the game as fully reviewed or clean.
- Read the current `.dazedtl/glossary.txt`, `.dazedtl/skills/quirks.md`, and
  `.dazedtl/skills/game.md` when present.
- Never modify or remove `_original` source fields.
- Do not promote a one-off joke or ambiguous coincidence into a global rule.
- Keep runtime, formatting, and exhaustive per-line checks in the normal QA workflow.

## Three-pass discovery

1. Freeze one starting packet containing the game paths, engine/version, applicable corpus map,
   short source-derived synopsis with its game-local and optional DLsite provenance, unchanged
   guidance, user-supplied hypotheses, and any raw Phase 1 candidates. Label the synopsis and
   starting guidance as orientation rather than corpus evidence. Do not add conclusions from the
   coordinator.
2. Launch exactly three fresh subagents concurrently with no forked conversation context; set
   `fork_turns="none"` when that control is available. Never show a worker either of the other
   reports.
3. Give all three workers the same self-contained packet and the Investigation method below. Tell
   each worker not to delegate, edit files, or write a report into the shared repository; it must
   inspect the corpus read-only and return its compact evidence report only to the coordinator.
   When a prompt explicitly designates you as one of these already-launched workers, do not run or
   repeat Three-pass discovery: perform the Investigation method exactly once and return your own
   report.
4. Keep the guidance files unchanged and do not synthesize or begin coordinator verification until
   all three reports are returned. If three isolated subagents cannot run concurrently, report the
   blocker rather than presenting serialized or repeated work as the requested parallel passes.
5. After all three passes, merge families by shared mechanism and anchors. Treat duplicate
   discoveries as convergence evidence, not waste; retain unique discoveries for equal verification.
   Then verify the union as described under Verification.

## One-pass discovery

1. Gather one starting packet containing the game paths, engine/version, applicable corpus map,
   short source-derived synopsis with its game-local and optional DLsite provenance, unchanged
   guidance, user-supplied hypotheses, and any raw Phase 1 candidates. Treat the synopsis and
   starting guidance as orientation rather than corpus evidence.
2. Perform the Investigation method below once yourself. Do not launch subagents for discovery;
   the user chose one pass to keep this step's cost down.
3. Keep the guidance files unchanged until your findings are complete, then verify them as
   described under Verification, as strictly as if another investigator had proposed them.

## Verification

Independently recount and inspect the proposed anchors, members, exceptions, and corrections against
the corpus. Treat starting guidance as hypotheses, not evidence; after discovery, audit anchored
quirks and game-specific glossary keys that have competing current English renderings. For
placeholder templates, inspect every distinct resolved value and relevant context; do not force one
English frame merely because the Japanese template is identical. Split the policy or retain a
backlog item when one frame is not natural for every member. Classify a correction as actionable
only when its text is player-visible and release-reachable; keep hidden scaffolding, test content,
and uncertain reachability in the backlog. If a canonical choice is a corpus minority, cite the
primary in-game label, self-identification, or explicit user instruction that outweighs frequency;
generated guidance alone is not proof. Only the coordinator, never a discovery worker, confirms
families and applies guidance.

## Investigation method

1. Start with the concrete candidate hypotheses collected by the baseline setup phase or supplied
   by the user. In standalone use, perform a brief corpus-wide survey only when no candidates exist.
2. Search for high-yield signals across the whole game, including:
   - recurring jokes, callbacks, catchphrases, coined words, and speech suffixes;
   - repeated scene structures whose Japanese wording varies, such as observation → coinage →
     deadpan repetition;
   - proper names whose reading may depend on character lore, naming-family morphology, mythology,
     titles, affiliations, motifs, or wordplay—not only kana-to-Latin phonetics;
   - suspicious romanization or untranslated common nouns;
   - the same Japanese translated several ways, or repeated English that erases distinct Japanese;
   - English lines that are locally intelligible but disconnected from adjacent setup or callbacks.
3. Rank concrete hypotheses by likely impact and evidentiary strength. Discard generic categories
   such as “there may be puns” unless actual source anchors or scene patterns support them.
4. Research each supported hypothesis globally with repository search and small scripts as needed.
   Search all maps, common events, and relevant databases rather than only early files. Inspect the
   complete local scene around every candidate. Deduplicate exact copies for analysis, but report
   the total number of occurrences and files/maps affected.

5. For each suspicious character name, enumerate competing spellings and build a compact evidence
   matrix. Evaluate evidence in this order, while recording contradictions and source quality:
   1. trustworthy creator or in-game Latin spelling;
   2. corpus structure and demonstrated naming-family morphology;
   3. attested lexical or proper-name candidates in plausible source languages;
   4. independent lore convergence, including explicit wordplay or callbacks;
   5. kana phonetics and the exact mismatch for each candidate; then
   6. a conservative naturalized fallback, clearly labeled editorial when ambiguity remains.

   Compare which candidates each item actually distinguishes. Repeated nameplates, database fields,
   and self-introductions establish identity or segmentation, not Latin orthography. Treat related
   lines from one role, motif, institution, or scene premise as one evidence class. Do not validate
   a spelling merely because every occurrence inherited the same provisional glossary guess.

   Research credible dictionaries and naming references rather than stopping at transliteration.
   Record meaning, pronunciation, morphology, and exact kana mismatch; compare cognates across
   plausible languages. An attested word whose meaning fits independent source anchors can outweigh
   a minor transcription irregularity. The irregularity remains contrary evidence, not a veto, and
   an otherwise unexplained mechanical spelling does not win solely by following kana more closely.

   Decide every component of a multi-part name independently. A common-noun reading supported only
   by one matching trait, dictionary existence, phonetic fit, or a language inferred from another
   component is weak; default to the conservative naturalized reading. Keep the common-noun reading
   eligible, however, and promote it when multiple independent naming signals converge—for example
   an unusually exact semantic callback plus demonstrated language or morphology, explicit
   wordplay, creator evidence, or parallel names. An attested proper name is a useful conservative
   candidate, not an automatic winner. Matching two dictionary words to two character traits does
   not by itself establish a compound naming pattern.

   Prefer the reading that explains the most independent, discriminating evidence with the fewest
   unsupported assumptions. Naturalize foreign or invented names for the player-facing language
   rather than preserving every kana mora mechanically. When the evidence remains close, retain a
   conservative reading and put the alternatives and exact missing evidence in the research backlog.
<!-- /character-name-evidence -->
6. Expand a family by its shared semantic, comic, or structural mechanism—not merely one repeated
   token. After finding a new variant, search again for its anchors and structural siblings until
   no new supported members appear.
7. Confirm a recurring family only when at least two independent examples or an explicit callback
   establish it. For each confirmed family, determine:
   - the Japanese mechanism and distinctive source anchors;
   - every supported member and meaningful exception;
   - one recognizable English mechanism or canonical term;
   - whether the rule belongs in Translation quirks, the Glossary, or a bounded correction list.
   For a confirmed faux name or other name-based joke, audit the final English Glossary target
   against that mechanism. When a natural, evidence-supported adaptation is possible, the target
   itself must carry the recognizable joke; do not merely transliterate the name and leave the
   wordplay only in its description. Retain a transliteration only when adaptation would distort
   the character's identity or tone, or no supportable English mechanism exists, and record that
   reason in the research backlog.
8. When the project is untranslated, emphasize preventive guidance. When English already exists,
   additionally identify inconsistent members and propose translation corrections, but do not
   apply those corrections. Proposed guidance goes to the coordinator, which applies confirmed
   guidance-file updates only after Verification (and, in Three-pass discovery, after synthesizing
   all three reports).
