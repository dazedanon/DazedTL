"""What the source text looked like, measured from the pixels.

The hard part of image translation was never "what colour should the English
be" - it was that every earlier attempt asked a vision model to *guess* it. Ask
instead what the pixels say, from a box a human has confirmed, and almost all of
it comes back exact: across the 18 test regions the text colour was recovered
exactly every time, and 17 of 18 backgrounds turned out to be transparent or
flat, which erase perfectly and for free.

The one thing measurement cannot recover is the typeface, so that stays the
user's knob. Everything else is a number with a confidence beside it, and the
Style panel exists to correct the minority that are wrong rather than to enter
the majority that are right.

Two rules keep this honest:

* **Sample the background from outside the box.** A confirmed box hugs the
  glyphs, so a ring drawn inside it is all ink and reports "no background
  found" on every region.
* **Never let the detector decide what ink is.** An edge mask outlines glyphs;
  erasing an outline leaves the glyph's interior behind as a ghost. Ink is
  decided by distance from the measured background, which covers the whole
  stroke.

No PyQt in here: it runs on a worker thread and in tests.
