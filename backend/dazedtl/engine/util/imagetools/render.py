"""Erase the source text, draw the translation.

The step everyone expected to need a model, and it needs none. `style.py`
measured what was there; this puts it back and writes the English over it.

Two things make that safe rather than reckless:

**Rendering always starts from the pristine original.** The first render stashes
a copy under ``.dazedtl/original`` and every render after that reads from it, so
a second pass cannot erase text that is already English and redraw it on top of
itself. Re-rendering is idempotent, which is what makes the preview loop usable
- the user can turn a knob twenty times and the twentieth result is as clean as
the first.

**Only the glyph pixels are erased, never the whole rectangle.** A confirmed
block routinely contains something that is not text - an icon beside a label, a
frame, a gradient - and blanking the box takes it with it.

Where the translation does not fit, there is a ladder rather than a failure:
wrap, shrink to 70% of the measured cap height, grow the box into space that is
provably empty, then shrink as far as legibility allows. Each rung is recorded
in the note, because "it fits" and "it fits because it is now 7pt" deserve
different reactions from the person looking at the preview.

    Three steps, in this order, and the order is what makes each of them right:

    **Draw at the face's own proportions.** The glyphs go onto a working tile
    scaled to undo both stretches, so the rasteriser is always asked for a shape
    the outline actually has. Drawing into a stretched grid instead asks it to
    invent one.

    **Stretch the finished fill.** Width and height are independent, which is
    what they are on Photoshop's Character panel: 50% height makes the letters
    half as tall and leaves them exactly as wide. Folding height into the point
    size instead - which is what this used to do - scales both, so the one
    control that exists to change the proportions could not change them.

    **Then stroke it.** After the stretch, so a 2px stroke is 2px on all four
    sides of a letter squeezed to 50%, rather than 1px at the sides and 2px top
    and bottom. The stroke is why the tile is drawn ``stroke`` pixels in from
    each edge: it needs somewhere to grow into that is still inside the block.

    The whole of it is carried as a single coverage channel and coloured at the
    end - see ``_layer`` for why - and the stroke is a dilation of that channel,
    which is how BallonsTranslator draws one and what Photoshop's "Stroke:
    Outside" means. Every edge gets a stroke because nothing decides which edges
    deserve one; a counter stays open until the stroke is wide enough to meet
    itself across it, and then closes, which is a reason to turn the width down
    rather than something to detect. The version this replaced did try to
    detect it - to tell a letter's counter from the gap between two letters by
    flooding the tile - and a flood cannot pass a pixel with *any* ink in it.
    Between letters set close together the antialiased rims meet, and that
    invisible 30%-alpha bridge fenced the gap off, so the stroke was taken out
