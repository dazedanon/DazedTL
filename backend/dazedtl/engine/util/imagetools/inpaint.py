"""Putting the artwork back where the source text was.

`style.py` decides *what* to erase and `render.py` decides *how*; this decides
what fills the hole when the answer is "reconstruct it". Six methods, in three
families:

* **Telea** and **Navier-Stokes** ship with OpenCV, cost nothing, and diffuse
  the surrounding colour inwards. They are honest on flat backgrounds and they
  smear on anything with a pattern in it.
* **PatchMatch** copies real patches from elsewhere in the picture instead of
  averaging, so screentone and hatching survive it. It is not a model - no
  weights, no runtime - but it does need a small prebuilt library.
* **LaMa**, **LaMa (manga)** and **AOT** are networks. They are the only ones
  that will invent plausible *structure* across a hole rather than blur over it.

Everything past the first family is optional in the same way the RapidOCR
fallback is: unavailable announces itself with the reason and the fix, and the
rest of the tool carries on without it. Nothing is ever downloaded
automatically - the files are the user's to place.

Two things about this job are specific to game art and are easy to get wrong.

**Alpha is a channel, not a flag.** A name plate is routinely drawn as opaque
white glyphs cut into a 70% black bar. Reconstruct only the three colour
channels and the glyphs' *opacity* survives untouched: a perfect silhouette of
the Japanese, fully opaque inside a translucent bar, which shows up over the
game background as a hard black shadow of the text that was supposed to be
gone. So alpha is reconstructed alongside colour, always, whichever method
filled the colour - and always classically, because none of these models has
ever seen an alpha channel.

**Transparent pixels have no colour to lend.** The RGB under alpha 0 is
whatever the exporter left there, usually black. A reconstruction that treats
those as context walks that black inwards and darkens the repair. They are
therefore added to the mask - marked unknown rather than believed - and what
comes back for them is discarded, since their alpha keeps them invisible.
