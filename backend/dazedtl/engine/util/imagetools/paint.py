"""The manual touch-up layer: two brushes, one file per image.

Measurement gets the background right often enough to be worth automating and
not often enough to be trusted blind. A caption sitting on a hand-drawn gradient,
a glyph whose antialiased tail reaches outside every box, an inpaint that guessed
a plausible-but-wrong shape - each is a ten-second fix by hand and an afternoon's
work to detect. So the fix is by hand.

**Strokes go under the English, never over it.** The layer is composited between
the erase pass and the draw pass, which makes it a *background repair* layer:
paint can fix anything the erase left behind, and can never end up sitting on top
of the translation when the type is later moved, resized or re-fitted. That
ordering is the whole reason ``render_entry`` runs in two passes.

Kept free of Qt so the renderer, the tests and any headless run can use it. The
canvas turns mouse events into calls on ``stroke``/``wipe``; everything below
here is numpy.
